It is not always an agreeable business to devote oneâ€™s time to
destroying a myth which has become lodged in the affections of the
people, but sometimes it rests on so slight a foundation that there
is nothing gained in keeping it alive. We have lately seen how the
tradition that Washington Irving used to live in the house on the
corner of Irving Place and Seventeenth Street had no foundation in
fact, except that he had a nephew who lived next door. And so the story
so often repeated in newspapers and guide books that the City Hall was
finished in brownstone at the back because the city fathers thought
that nobody of any importance would ever live to the north of it might,
it seems, be set at rest, although the attempt is not made for the
first time. The story reflects on the intelligence of the people of the
day. The reason was economy, but not joined to deficiency of foresight.
